
Here's a breakdown of MPLS configuration for CE (Customer Edge), P (Provider), and PE (Provider Edge) routers:

CE Router:

No direct MPLS configuration required on the CE router.
Configure routing protocols (OSPF, BGP) to advertise prefixes towards the PE router.

P Router (Core Router):

Enable MPLS:

mpls label-switched
Routing Protocol Configuration:

Configure routing protocols (OSPF or BGP) for exchanging reachability information with other P and PE routers
LDP Configuration:

Enable LDP on P router interfaces connecting to PE routers.
Configure neighbors for LDP to exchange label information with PE routers.
